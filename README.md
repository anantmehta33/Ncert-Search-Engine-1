# About the project:
Central Board in India has prescribed 'NCERT' books in India. This extractive search engine is based on the
NCERT 'History' book (class 10). Moreover, this search engine can also deal with class 9th queries also for the CBSE board students.<br>
• The answer to a question is going to be determined by the response that is provided in the book itself, together with the context.<br>
• Top five documents would be retieved and displayed along with their confidence scores. <br>
• A student can bookmark and download the responses as well. <br>
• Additional facilities like browsing search history and changing profile settings are also provided. <br>
