Pastoralism in Africa
Let us move to Africa where over half the world’s pastoral population
lives. Even today, over 22 million Africans depend on some form of
pastoral activity for their livelihood. They include communities like
Bedouins, Berbers, Maasai, Somali, Boran and Turkana. Most of
them now live in the semi-arid grasslands or arid deserts where rainfed
agriculture is difficult. They raise cattle, camels, goats, sheep and
donkeys; and they sell milk, meat, animal skin and wool. Some also
earn through trade and transport, others combine pastoral activity
with agriculture; still others do a variety of odd jobs to supplement
their meagre and uncertain earnings from pastoralism.
Like pastoralists in India, the lives of African pastoralists have changed
dramatically over the colonial and post-colonial periods. What have
these changes been?
We will discuss some of these changes by looking at one pastoral
community – the Maasai – in some detail. The Maasai cattle herders
live primarily in east Africa: 300, 000 in southern Kenya and another
150,000 in Tanzania. We will see how new laws and regulations took
away their land and restricted their movement. This affected their
lives in times of drought and even reshaped their social relationships.
