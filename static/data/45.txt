3.2 The Revolution of October 1917
As the conflict between the Provisional Government and the
Bolsheviks grew, Lenin feared the Provisional Government would
set up a dictatorship. In September, he began discussions for an
uprising against the government. Bolshevik supporters in the army,
soviets and factories were brought together.
On 16 October 1917, Lenin persuaded the Petrograd Soviet and
the Bolshevik Party to agree to a socialist seizure of power. A
Military Revolutionary Committee was appointed by the Soviet
under Leon Trotskii to organise the seizure. The date of the event
was kept a secret.
The uprising began on 24 October. Sensing trouble, Prime Minister
Kerenskii had left the city to summon troops. At dawn, military
men loyal to the government seized the buildings of two Bolshevik
newspapers. Pro-government troops were sent to take over telephone
and telegraph offices and protect the Winter Palace. In a swift
response, the Military Revolutionary Committee ordered its
supporters to seize government offices and arrest ministers. Late in
the day, the ship Aurora shelled the Winter Palace. Other vessels
sailed down the Neva and took over various military points. By
nightfall, the city was under the committee’s control and the
ministers had surrendered. At a meeting of the All Russian Congress
of Soviets in Petrograd, the majority approved the Bolshevik action.
Uprisings took place in other cities. There was heavy fighting –
especially in Moscow – but by December, the Bolsheviks controlled
the Moscow-Petrograd area
