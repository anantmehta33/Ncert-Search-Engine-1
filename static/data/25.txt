The Nazi Worldview
The crimes that Nazis committed were linked to a system of belief
and a set of practices.
Nazi ideology was synonymous with Hitler’s worldview. According
to this there was no equality between people, but only a racial
hierarchy. In this view blond, blue-eyed, Nordic German Aryans
were at the top, while Jews were located at the lowest rung. They
came to be regarded as an anti-race, the arch-enemies of the Aryans.
All other coloured people were placed in between depending upon
their external features. Hitler’s racism borrowed from thinkers like
Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer. Darwin was a natural scientist
who tried to explain the creation of plants and animals through the
concept of evolution and natural selection. Herbert Spencer later
added the idea of survival of the fittest. According to this idea, only
those species survived on earth that could adapt themselves to
changing climatic conditions. We should bear in mind that Darwin
never advocated human intervention in what he thought was a purely
natural process of selection. However, his ideas were used by racist
thinkers and politicians to justify imperial rule over conquered
peoples. The Nazi argument was simple: the strongest race would
survive and the weak ones would perish. The Aryan race was the
finest. It had to retain its purity, become stronger and dominate the
world.
The other aspect of Hitler’s ideology related to the geopolitical
concept of Lebensraum, or living space. He believed that new territories
had to be acquired for settlement. This would enhance the area of
the mother country, while enabling the settlers on new lands to retain
an intimate link with the place of their origin. It would also enhance
the material resources and power of the German nation.
Hitler intended to extend German boundaries by moving eastwards,
to concentrate all Germans geographically in one place. Poland became
the laboratory for this experimentation.
