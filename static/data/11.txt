A Directory Rules France
The fall of the Jacobin government allowed the wealthier middle
classes to seize power. A new constitution was introduced which
denied the vote to non-propertied sections of society. It provided
for two elected legislative councils. These then appointed a Directory,
an executive made up of five members. This was meant as a safeguard
against the concentration of power in a one-man executive as under
the Jacobins. However, the Directors often clashed with the legislative
councils, who then sought to dismiss them. The political instability
of the Directory paved the way for the rise of a military dictator,
Napoleon Bonaparte.
Through all these changes in the form of government, the ideals of
freedom, of equality before the law and of fraternity remained inspiring
ideals that motivated political movements in France and the rest of Europe
during the following century.
