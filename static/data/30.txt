The Art of Propaganda
The Nazi regime used language and media with care, and often to
great effect. The terms they coined to describe their various
practices are not only deceptive. They are chilling. Nazis never
used the words ‘kill’ or ‘murder’ in their official communications.
Mass killings were termed special treatment, final solution (for the Jews),
euthanasia (for the disabled), selection and disinfections. ‘Evacuation’
meant deporting people to gas chambers. Do you know what the
gas chambers were called? They were labelled ‘disinfection-areas’,
and looked like bathrooms equipped with fake showerheads.
Media was carefully used to win support for the regime and
popularise its worldview. Nazi ideas were spread through visual
images, films, radio, posters, catchy slogans and leaflets. In posters,
groups identified as the ‘enemies’ of Germans were stereotyped,
mocked, abused and described as evil. Socialists and liberals were
represented as weak and degenerate. They were attacked as
malicious foreign agents. Propaganda films were made to create
hatred for Jews. The most infamous film was The Eternal Jew.
Orthodox Jews were stereotyped and marked. They were shown
with flowing beards wearing kaftans, whereas in reality it was
difficult to distinguish German Jews by their outward appearance
because they were a highly assimilated community. They were
referred to as vermin, rats and pests. Their movements were compared
to those of rodents. Nazism worked on the minds of the people,
tapped their emotions, and turned their hatred and anger at those
marked as ‘undesirable’.
The Nazis made equal efforts to appeal to all the different sections of
the population. They sought to win their support by suggesting that
Nazis alone could solve all their problems.
