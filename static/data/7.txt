France Becomes a Constitutional Monarchy
The National Assembly completed the draft of the constitution in
1791. Its main object was to limit the powers of the monarch. These
powers instead of being concentrated in the hands of one person,
were now separated and assigned to different institutions – the
legislature, executive and judiciary. This made France a constitutional
monarchy. Fig. 7 explains how the new political system worked.
The Constitution of 1791 vested the power to make laws in the
National Assembly, which was indirectly elected. That is, citizens
voted for a group of electors, who in turn chose the Assembly. Not
all citizens, however, had the right to vote. Only men above 25 years
of age who paid taxes equal to at least 3 days of a labourer’s wage
were given the status of active citizens, that is, they were entitled to
vote. The remaining men and all women were classed as passive
citizens. To qualify as an elector and then as a member of the Assembly,
a man had to belong to the highest bracket of taxpayers.
The Constitution began with a Declaration of the Rights of Man
and Citizen. Rights such as the right to life, freedom of speech,
freedom of opinion, equality before law, were established as ‘natural
and inalienable’ rights, that is, they belonged to each human being
by birth and could not be taken away. It was the duty of the state to
protect each citizen’s natural rights.
