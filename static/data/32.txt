Knowledge about the Holocaust
Information about Nazi practices had trickled out of Germany
during the last years of the regime. But it was only after the war
ended and Germany was defeated that the world came to realise the
horrors of what had happened. While the Germans were preoccupied
with their own plight as a defeated nation emerging out of the rubble,
the Jews wanted the world to remember the atrocities and sufferings
they had endured during the Nazi killing operations â€“ also called the
Holocaust. At its height, a ghetto inhabitant had said to another that
he wanted to outlive the war just for half an hour. Presumably he
meant that he wanted to be able to tell the world about what had
happened in Nazi Germany. This indomitable spirit to bear witness
and to preserve the documents can be seen in many ghetto and camp
inhabitants who wrote diaries, kept notebooks, and created archives.
On the other hand when the war seemed lost, the Nazi leadership
distributed petrol to its functionaries to destroy all incriminating
evidence available in offices.
Yet the history and the memory of the Holocaust live on in memoirs,
fiction, documentaries, poetry, memorials and museums in many
parts of the world today. These are a tribute to those who resisted it,
an embarrassing reminder to those who collaborated, and a warning
to those who watched in silence.
