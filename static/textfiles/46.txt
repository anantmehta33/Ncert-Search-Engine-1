What Changed after October?
The Bolsheviks were totally opposed to private property. Most
industry and banks were nationalised in November 1917. This meant
that the government took over ownership and management. Land
was declared social property and peasants were allowed to seize the
land of the nobility. In cities, Bolsheviks enforced the partition of
large houses according to family requirements. They banned the
use of the old titles of aristocracy. To assert the change, new
uniforms were designed for the army and officials, following a
clothing competition organised in 1918 â€“ when the Soviet hat
(budeonovka) was chosen.
The Bolshevik Party was renamed the Russian Communist Party
(Bolshevik). In November 1917, the Bolsheviks conducted the
elections to the Constituent Assembly, but they failed to gain
majority support. In January 1918, the Assembly rejected Bolshevik
measures and Lenin dismissed the Assembly. He thought the All
Russian Congress of Soviets was more democratic than an assembly
elected in uncertain conditions. In March 1918, despite opposition
by their political allies, the Bolsheviks made peace with Germany
at Brest Litovsk. In the years that
followed, the Bolsheviks became
the only party to participate in the
elections to the All Russian
Congress of Soviets, which became
the Parliament of the country.
Russia became a one-party state.
Trade unions were kept under
party control. The secret police
(called the Cheka first, and later
OGPU and NKVD) punished
those who criticised the
Bolsheviks. Many young writers
and artists rallied to the Party
because it stood for socialism and
for change. After October 1917,
this led to experiments in the arts
and architecture. But many became
disillusioned because of the
censorship the Party encouraged
