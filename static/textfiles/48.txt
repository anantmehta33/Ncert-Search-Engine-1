4.2 Making a Socialist Society
During the civil war, the Bolsheviks kept industries and banks
nationalised. They permitted peasants to cultivate the land that had
been socialised. Bolsheviks used confiscated land to demonstrate what
collective work could be.
A process of centralised planning was introduced. Officials assessed
how the economy could work and set targets for a five-year period.
On this basis they made the Five Year Plans. The government fixed
all prices to promote industrial growth during the first two ‘Plans’
(1927-1932 and 1933-1938). Centralised planning led to economic
growth. Industrial production increased (between 1929 and 1933 by
100 per cent in the case of oil, coal and steel). New factory cities
came into being.
However, rapid construction led to poor working conditions. In
the city of Magnitogorsk, the construction of a steel plant was achieved
in three years. Workers lived hard lives and the result was 550
stoppages of work in the first year alone. In living quarters, ‘in the
wintertime, at 40 degrees below, people had to climb down from the
fourth floor and dash across the street in order to go to the toilet’.
An extended schooling system developed, and arrangements were
made for factory workers and peasants to enter universities. Crèches
were established in factories for the children of women workers.
Cheap public health care was provided. Model living quarters were
set up for workers. The effect of all this was uneven, though, since
government resources were limited.
