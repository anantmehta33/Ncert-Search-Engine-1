Abbé Sieyès, originally a priest, wrote an influential pamphlet called
‘What is the Third Estate’?
While the National Assembly was busy at Versailles drafting a
constitution, the rest of France seethed with turmoil. A severe winter
had meant a bad harvest; the price of bread rose, often bakers exploited
the situation and hoarded supplies. After spending hours in long
queues at the bakery, crowds of angry women stormed into the
shops. At the same time, the king ordered troops to move into Paris.
On 14 July, the agitated crowd stormed and destroyed the Bastille.
In the countryside rumours spread from village to village that the
lords of the manor had hired bands of brigands who were on their
way to destroy the ripe crops. Caught in a frenzy of fear, peasants in
several districts seized hoes and pitchforks and attacked chateaux.
They looted hoarded grain and burnt down documents containing
records of manorial dues. A large number of nobles fled from their
homes, many of them migrating to neighbouring countries.
Faced with the power of his revolting subjects, Louis XVI finally
accorded recognition to the National Assembly and accepted the
principle that his powers would from now on be checked by a
constitution. On the night of 4 August 1789, the Assembly passed a
decree abolishing the feudal system of obligations and taxes. Members
of the clergy too were forced to give up their privileges. Tithes were
abolished and lands owned by the Church were confiscated. As a
result, the government acquired assets worth at least 2 billion livres.
