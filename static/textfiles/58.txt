2.4 New Trades, New Employments and New Services
While people lost out in many ways after the forest department
took control of the forests, some people benefited from the new
opportunities that had opened up in trade. Many communities left
their traditional occupations and started trading in forest products.
This happened not only in India but across the world. For example,
with the growing demand for rubber in the mid-nineteenth century,
the Mundurucu peoples of the Brazilian Amazon who lived in villages
on high ground and cultivated manioc, began to collect latex from
wild rubber trees for supplying to traders. Gradually, they descended
to live in trading posts and became completely dependent on traders.
In India, the trade in forest products was not new. From the medieval
period onwards, we have records of adivasi communities trading
elephants and other goods like hides, horns, silk cocoons, ivory,
bamboo, spices, fibres, grasses, gums and resins through nomadic
communities like the Banjaras.
With the coming of the British, however, trade was completely
regulated by the government. The British government gave many
large European trading firms the sole right to trade in the forest
products of particular areas. Grazing and hunting by local people
were restricted. In the process, many pastoralist and nomadic
communities like the Korava, Karacha and Yerukula of the Madras
Presidency lost their livelihoods. Some of them began to be called
‘criminal tribes’, and were forced to work instead in factories,
mines and plantations, under government supervision.
New opportunities of work did not always mean improved wellbeing for the people. In Assam, both men and women from forest
communities like Santhals and Oraons from Jharkhand, and
Gonds from Chhattisgarh were recruited to work on tea
plantations. Their wages were low and conditions of work were
very bad. They could not return easily to their home villages
from where they had been recruited.
