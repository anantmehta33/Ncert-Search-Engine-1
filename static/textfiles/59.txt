In many parts of India, and across the world, forest communities
rebelled against the changes that were being imposed on them. The
leaders of these movements against the British like Siddhu and Kanu
in the Santhal Parganas, Birsa Munda of Chhotanagpur or Alluri
Sitarama Raju of Andhra Pradesh are still remembered today in songs
and stories. We will now discuss in detail one such rebellion which
took place in the kingdom of Bastar in 1910.
3.1 The People of Bastar
Bastar is located in the southernmost part of Chhattisgarh and
borders Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Maharashtra. The central part
of Bastar is on a plateau. To the north of this plateau is the
Chhattisgarh plain and to its south is the Godavari plain. The river
Indrawati winds across Bastar east to west. A number of different
communities live in Bastar such as Maria and Muria Gonds, Dhurwas,
Bhatras and Halbas. They speak different languages but share
common customs and beliefs. The people of Bastar believe that each
village was given its land by the Earth, and in return, they look after
the earth by making some offerings at each agricultural festival. In
addition to the Earth, they show respect to the spirits of the river,
the forest and the mountain. Since each village knows where its
boundaries lie, the local people look after all the natural resources
within that boundary. If people from a village want to take some
wood from the forests of another village, they pay a small fee called
devsari, dand or man in exchange. Some villages also protect their forests
by engaging watchmen and each household contributes some grain
to pay them. Every year there is one big hunt where the headmen of
villages in a pargana (cluster of villages) meet and discuss issues of
concern, including forests.
