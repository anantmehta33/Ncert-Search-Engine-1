Who could Hunt?
The new forest laws changed the lives of forest dwellers in yet another
way. Before the forest laws, many people who lived in or near forests
had survived by hunting deer, partridges and a variety of small
animals. This customary practice was prohibited by the forest laws.
Those who were caught hunting were now punished for poaching.
While the forest laws deprived people of their customary rights to
hunt, hunting of big game became a sport. In India, hunting of tigers
and other animals had been part of the culture of the court and
nobility for centuries. Many Mughal paintings show princes and
emperors enjoying a hunt. But under colonial rule the scale of hunting
increased to such an extent that various species became almost extinct.
The British saw large animals as signs of a wild, primitive and savage
society. They believed that by killing dangerous animals the British
would civilise India. They gave rewards for the killing of tigers, wolves
and other large animals on the grounds that they posed a threat to
cultivators. 0ver 80,000 tigers, 150,000 leopards and 200,000 wolves
were killed for reward in the period 1875-1925. Gradually, the tiger
came to be seen as a sporting trophy. The Maharaja of Sarguja alone
shot 1,157 tigers and 2,000 leopards up to 1957. A British
administrator, George Yule, killed 400 tigers. Initially certain areas
of forests were reserved for hunting. Only much later did
environmentalists and conservators begin to argue that all these species
of animals needed to be protected, and not killed.
